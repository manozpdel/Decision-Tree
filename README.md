# Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for implementing decision tree classifiers on two different datasets: "Salaries" and "Titanic".

## Datasets

### 1. Salaries Dataset
- This dataset contains information about employees, including features such as years of experience, job role, and salary.
- The aim is to build a decision tree model to predict the salary of an employee based on given features.

### 2. Titanic Dataset
- The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status.
- The goal is to utilize a decision tree classifier to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available data.

## Files
- `salaries_decision_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing code for implementing a decision tree classifier on the salaries dataset.
- `titanic_decision_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing code for implementing a decision tree classifier on the Titanic dataset.

## Dependencies
To run the Jupyter Notebook files, you will need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
